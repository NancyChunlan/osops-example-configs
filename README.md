# example-configs
Example configurations, sanitized from real environments

How to use:

1) Create directory

2) Add a README.md in that directory describing your environment

3) SANITIZE YOUR CONFIGS BEFORE FIRST COMMIT

4) Add configs, CM descriptions, etc. that make sense from your environment in a logical way

5) Push up to github!

# External Example Repositories

Some sites have open versions of their configs and/or config
management systems online in other places.  Here's a list of the ones
we know about:

* https://github.com/bloomberg/chef-bcpc/tree/master/cookbooks/bcpc/templates/default
  Bloomberg's configs are open source (apart from things like ips,
  tokens and such) and in chef templates. Thats what we run in
  production on several clusters at the moment.
